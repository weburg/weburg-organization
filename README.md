# Weburg Organization

## A repository to note the organization conventions, policies, and to host discussions

### Conventions

- All repository names should be named with kebab-case
- All repositories should strive to have a GPL-3.0 LICENSE file.
- All README.md should have a heading 1 title, a heading 2 short description, and heading 3 sections. Rely on GitHub to provide the table of contents.
- The heading 1 title should be a prettier formatting of the repository title. It can have some extra wording, but keep it short.
- The heading 2 short description should match the repository description. It shouldn't have a period at the end unless it's more than a sentence.
- Namespace code as much as possible to com.weburg.module or weburg/module depending on programming language. Namespaces and nested directory structures should generally match.
- Keep things as simple as possible. Avoid repetition when able.

### Being considered

- Strive to have a .gitignore for every repository.
- For projects using IDEA IDEs, strive to have .idea/.name checked in to make the project name look prettier in the IDEs.
